                (Silver Spring, MD) – Credit card companies have seen firsthand
                the destruction Covid has had on the American consumer. With
                millions of Americans out of work and millions more struggling
                to make ends meet, the credit card companies are finding
                themselves in a situation and have

                Visa and Mastercard have long had a hidden tactic they keep
                secret to help the American consumer reduce their monthly
                payments, and <u>lower the interest they are being charged</u>,
                up until Covid they have kept this a secret but now thanks to
                legislation, and sunlight the credit card companies can no
                longer hide this incredible benefit to consumers like you.

                Back in the early 80’s the government with the help of the
                credit card companies setup a sort of failsafe for consumers who
                found themselves with a lot of credit card debt and high monthly
                payments resulting in a quicksand type feeling when it came to
                paying their bills.

                The government didn’t want consumers to be taken advantage of so
                they created “credit counseling” which in the late 90’s early
                2000’s was overrun by bad actors, however the credit counseling
                agencies of today have been highly regulated and are true
                stewards of financial solvency for the American public.

                see a 53% reduction in monthly payment, and find themselves out

                they are a bit exclusive, if you don’t respond to their first
                contact they most likely will take that spot and give it to the
                next applicant, they are not known to call you over and over
                until you signup, they want to help people who need and want the
