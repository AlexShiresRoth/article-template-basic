                Upon receiving a magnetic lash kit, you‚Äôll notice each kit comes
                with at least two lash strips (one for each eye), a pair of
                tweezers (in most kits) and most importantly, the magnetic liner
                that helps the lashes adhere to your top eyelid, where it
                should, theoretically, hold all day long.

              <h2>The Science Behind Magnetic Lashes</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                The magnetic liner is a liquid liner that applies much like a
                regular black liquid liner you would use to create a ‚Äúwing.‚Äù
                It‚Äôs made up of iron oxides which help the magnets on the strips
                of the lashes adhere to the magnetic liquid liner applied to the
                eyelid for all-day-hold, which is perfectly safe for use on the
                eyelid as regulated by the FDA (many other eye shadows and eye
                liners are comprised of some amount of iron oxides). The
                magnetic liners are paraben-free and many magnetic lash brands
                are now cruelty-free and vegan!
              </p>
              <p>
                Many people have concerns over the effects of having magnets so
                close to their eyes, however eye doctors have confirmed that
                there is no problem with having magnets adhere to the eyelid, so
                long as they don‚Äôt penetrate into the eye. Magnets do not cause
                any kind of disruption in eye movement or vision either.

              <h2>How You Apply The Lashes</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box">
              <p>
                Make sure to shake up the liquid magnetic liner before every
                use. Apply the liner along your top eyelid until you reach your
                desired look. Wait until the liner has dried about 80% of the
                way (liner should feel slightly tacky, but should not come off
                onto your fingertip when you touch it). Remove one lash strip
                from your kit compact and measure the length of the strip
                against your eye (trim any excess lash strip starting from the
                side of the strip that touches the inner corner of your eye),
                and once the fit on your eye is right, gently hold the magnetic
                end of the lash strips to your lined eyelid and watch as the
                lash clings on. Once the positioning is just right, repeat the
                same steps with the other eye and you‚Äôre fresh and fabulous in
                just a few minutes! (Application time may vary depending on
                familiarity with applying fake lashes on yourself).

                Theoretically, magnetic lashes will stay put the entire day, as
                long as you apply them and care for them the right way. Many
                magnetic lash brands run the ‚Äúhair dryer test‚Äù to show how the
                lashes react to external obstacles like wind and heat especially
                after a full day of wearing them, and most brands pass
                (depending on quality of product). So not only are they easier
                to apply than glue lashes, but they also stay intact for longer.

                Most magnetic lash brands can last you up to 30 uses, meaning
                you can buy one kit and reuse it 30 times before needing to buy
                another which saves you a lot of moola, considering glue lashes
                are disposable and can typically only be worn one time. To give
                your magnetic lashes the best care possible, always gently clean
                them with a little water after removing them, gently pat them
                dry and put the back in the magnetic compact so they‚Äôre always
                in a safe and protective space, ready for the next time you wear
                them.

                While many of the big magnetic lash distributors like Glamnetic
                and Moxie Lash charge as much as $30 for one set of magnetic
                lashes (not including the liquid magnetic liner which is an
                additional $40 at least!), other players like Slick can offer

                In all honesty, we all know that traditional glue-on lashes
                suck. They‚Äôre difficult to apply, can wear on and ruin your real
                lashes, and are only good for one use. Being that magnetic
                lashes are more cost-effective, safer and healthier for your
                real lashes and easier to apply than traditional glue lashes,
                AND look just as HOT as glue lashes (if not more!), we agree
                that magnetic lashes are totally worth the hype! We hope you‚Äôll
